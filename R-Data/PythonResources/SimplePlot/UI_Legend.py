################Simple Plot Method####################
######################################################

After seeing the complexity of Matplotlib regarding 
memory management I (Alexander Schober) have decided 
to work on my own plotting framework based on the
simple TKinter intherface. It allows object oriented
plotting and enough maniability to be used. 
Further more it allows for cross platform maniability.

A plot consists of different layers which have to be
taylored. This includes an axes layer and a draw layer. 
All plots and there information will saved into the 
Drawer. He is the main draw manager of the instance.
To him everything is linked that needs to be.
Note that he manages following instances:

- Axes (BUILT)
    All axes are defined by the axes class and drawn by here:
        - Grid Lines    (BUILT)
        - Tick Lines    (BUILT)
        - Tick Labels   (BUILT)
        - Axes lines    (BUILT)
        - inside padding    (BUILT)
        - outside padding   (BUILT)
        
- Zoomer (BUILT)
    He will manage the zoom box activated upon clicking
    
        - Zoom routines
        - Zoom bindings
        - Zoom box draw and refresh on move
        - unzoom on rightclick 
        - focused zoom on doubleclick
        
- Pointer (BUILT)
    The pointer method will decide what to do with 
    the mouse. While the mouse in matplotlib is
    very sluggish to code it was found that the 
    tkinter canvas manages it very smoothly. This
    is how we shall proceed. In the future we will 
    propose a variaty of crosshairs. Note that
    the canvas coordinates have to be fetched from 
    the root canvas method
    
- Mouse (BUILT)

- Key (BUILT)

- Keyboard (BUILT)

- Drawer (BUILT)

- MultiplotCanvas Accounts for multiple subplots.... (BUILT)

        in an effort to be more modulable it tought more
        advantageouse to creta a class for each plot. This way
        the parameters and adresses are more obvious.
        
        it will also allow easier fetching in the settings
        to allow data manipulation and statistics
